This project contains my implementation of the UNet algorithm (Python, Tensorflow).

The data I used to train and test my model can be found at this address: https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/overview.

Scripts:

-  data_analysis.ipynb contains data analysis and masks visualisation;

-  model.py contains a class for creating the model;

*  train.py shows the code I used to train the model;

*  datasets.py contains code to create datasets;

*  utils.py contains some functions used in other scripts;

*  inference.py creates .csv file with model predictions.
